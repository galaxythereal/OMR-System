## Introduction

### Motivation & Seeing Opportunity

### Other Considered Project Ideas

- Creating  a Facial Recognition system as employees of FEE line up in a lengthy queue every morning and afternoon to use the fingerprint attendance system causing inconvenience & delay for them and jamming at the main gate

  ![](C:\Users\mahmo\Downloads\images.jpg)

- Number plate recognition system that will allow the security personnel to know the authorized cars

### The Chosen Project

- Due to budget and timing constraints we decided to go with the OMR Bubble sheet Marking System
- The project is built to continue and we plan on deploying it on a hardware chip (e.g Raspberry Pi or some other cheaper alternative) along with a camera module and use it in our faculty as a student led initiative and hopefully we inspire and motivate the surrounding environment to think of such ideas that will benefit our community and solve real life problems

## Project Proposal

### Executive Summary

The proposed Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system addresses a critical need within our educational institution for efficient and accurate processing of multiple-choice examinations. The current manual grading process is time-consuming and prone to human error. Our solution leverages computer vision and machine learning technologies to automate the grading process, significantly reducing processing time and improving accuracy.



### Problem Statement

Faculty members currently spend considerable time manually grading multiple-choice examinations, leading to:

- Delayed feedback to students
- Potential human errors in grading
- Resource inefficiency in academic staff allocation
- Lack of standardization in the grading process
- Significant time investment from faculty members in manual grading

### Project Objectives

1. Develop an automated OMR system using computer vision and deep learning
2. Handling various lighting conditions and paper orientations
3. Achieve grading accuracy exceeding 99%
4. Reduce grading time by at least 90% compared to manual processing
5. Create a system that can be easily integrated into existing examination workflows

### Methodology

#### System Architecture

The implemented OMR system employs a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that combines computer vision techniques with deep learning for accurate bubble sheet processing.

#### Image Acquisition and Preprocessing

The system begins with robust image preprocessing using OpenCV. The implementation utilizes a series of carefully tuned operations:

```python
img = cv2.resize(img, (widthImg, heightImg))
imgGray = cv2.cvtColor(img, COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
imgBlur = cv2.GaussianBlur(imgGray, (5, 5), 1)
imgCanny = cv2.Canny(imgBlur, 10, 70)
```

This preprocessing stage ensures consistent image quality regardless of input variations. The Gaussian blur with a 5x5 kernel effectively reduces noise while preserving essential edge information, and the carefully tuned Canny edge detection parameters (10, 70) provide optimal edge detection for subsequent processing.

#### Answer Sheet Detection and Registration

The sheet detection process employs contour analysis and perspective transformation:

```python
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(imgCanny, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)
rectCon = utlis.rectContour(contours)
biggestPoints = utlis.getCornerPoints(rectCon[0])
```

The system implements a sophisticated corner detection algorithm that:

1. Identifies the main answer sheet area using contour analysis
2. Filters rectangular contours to locate the answer grid
3. Applies perspective transformation to normalize the view angle

The perspective transformation is achieved through:

```python
pts1 = np.float32(biggestPoints)
pts2 = np.float32([[0, 0],[widthImg, 0], [0, heightImg],[widthImg, heightImg]])
matrix = cv2.getPerspectiveTransform(pts1, pts2)
imgWarpColored = cv2.warpPerspective(img, matrix, (widthImg, heightImg))
```

#### Bubble Detection and Classification

The bubble detection pipeline incorporates multiple stages:

1. **Thresholding and Isolation**

```python
imgWarpGray = cv2.cvtColor(imgWarpColored, COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
imgThresh = cv2.threshold(imgWarpGray, 170, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)[1]
```

2. **Grid Segmentation**
   The system employs a custom splitting algorithm to isolate individual bubbles:

```python
boxes = utlis.splitBoxes(imgThresh)
myPixelVal = np.zeros((questions, choices))
```

3. **Deep Learning Classification**
   A custom Convolutional Neural Network architecture processes each bubble:

```python
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])
```

This architecture features:

- Three convolutional layers with increasing filter counts (32, 64, 128)
- MaxPooling layers for spatial dimension reduction
- Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Binary classification output (filled vs. empty)

#### Data Augmentation Strategy

The training pipeline implements comprehensive data augmentation:

```python
def augment_image(image, label):
    image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image)
    image = tf.image.random_flip_up_down(image)
    image = tf.image.random_brightness(image, max_delta=0.3)
    image = tf.image.random_contrast(image, lower=0.7, upper=1.3)
    image = tf.image.random_saturation(image, lower=0.7, upper=1.3)
    return image, label
```

This augmentation approach ensures model robustness by simulating various real-world conditions:

- Geometric variations through flipping
- Lighting variations through brightness and contrast adjustments
- Color variations through saturation modification

#### Result Processing and Validation

The system implements a comprehensive validation pipeline:

1. **Answer Processing**

```python
myIndex = np.argmax(myPixelVal, axis=1)
grading = np.equal(ans, myIndex).astype(int)
score = (np.sum(grading) / questions) * 100
```

2. **Visual Feedback Generation**

```python
utlis.showAnswers(imgWarpColored, myIndex, grading, ans)
utlis.drawGrid(imgWarpColored)
```

3. **Result Visualization**
   The system generates a detailed visual output showing:

- Original and processed images
- Detected answers
- Correct/incorrect marking
- Final score display

#### Model Training and Evaluation

The training process incorporates:

1. Dataset splitting (80% training, 10% validation, 10% test)
2. Early stopping and model checkpointing

```python
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('best_model.keras',
                           monitor='val_loss',
                           save_best_only=True,
                           mode='min')
```

3. Batch processing with size optimization

```python
epochs = 20
batch_size = 16
```

This comprehensive methodology ensures robust performance across various real-world conditions while maintaining high accuracy and processing speed.
